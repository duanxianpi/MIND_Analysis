But before all that, there were a few more Blind Auditions, including one form Season 17's new heartthrob, Matthew McQueen. He may not be related to Steve McQueen, but he had undeniable star power -- with a pretty face and a pretty voice to match plus just the right about of darkness and edge. ""He kind of looks like a combination of Tom Cruise and Christian Bale. You're like a very handsome movie villain,"" John Legend told Matthew. ""Like a vampire. You could be in a vampire movie,"" said Kelly Clarkson, who seemed a little flustered as she called the 21-year-old indie-pop crooner ""so cool and sexy -- I mean, not in a weird way!"" Blake Shelton compared Matthew's modern-sounding vocals to that of another heartthrob, Shawn Mendes. So I guess music really was in Matthew's, um, blood. [insert/quote some tweets] Matthew's cover artist-of-the-moment's Lewis Capaldi's weeper ""Someone You Loved"" was haunting, and not just because he looked like Lestat while singing it. I was impressed by his sense of dynamics, the way he started soft and subtle and built the song to its anguished crescendo, instead of starting at full volume. It was a sophisticated and nuanced performance. ""You got better and better and you kept it classy, you kept it tasteful. When you get into that rasp -- like, whew,"" Kelly marveled. It seemed like Kelly might be on her way to a third victory by getting Matthew on her team, but unfortunately for her, Blake also turned around. He made a very good case, noting that three of his past six winners were not country singers, stating, ""It doesn't matter what lane your coach is in. It's what lane your coach can put you in.""

The Kincade Fire, which started the previous week, was one of a series of wildfires that ravaged parts of California in recent weeks and prompted red flag warnings across much of the state. Fire officials reportedly urged residents to prepare for high winds forecast to peak in the early hours of Wednesday, October 30. The winds were expected too lessen later that day. ""Conditions are as dangerous for fire growth and behavior as we have seen in recent history,"" the Los Angeles Fire Department said. Governor of California Gavin Newsom on Sunday declared a statewide emergency and evacuation warnings remain in place due to the threat of strong winds and low humidity. About 200,000 people have reportedly been forced from their homes. This video was shared by Sonoma County Firefighters. It was taken on October 27, they said.

Property owner Kerry Swain told Storyful the ewes and lambs had been moving to the small green patch of grass at 6am every morning for a feed. ""This is the only green section on our property as it is where the drain runs out to the paddock,"" she said. ""Every morning I hear the little lambs baaing and bleating away. They are very happy to be on the green grass. It's a nice sound in a time of drought."" Mrs Swain told Storyful her property, 'Oralla', had been in the family since 1852 and had never experienced issues with a lack of water until now. The Bureau of Meteorology has recorded rainfall deficiencies in New South Wales and southern Queensland over the past 17 months, with several areas experiencing their lowest-ever rainfalls. New South Wales is experiencing near-total drought conditions, while around two-thirds of Queensland is in drought. ""My son is a sixth-generation farmer. Our family has never seen it like this.

Christina Edwards, Jonathan's mom, recorded this footage on September 20. Christina told Storyful the high school senior attended a few ASL classes over the summer with the goal of performing. ""During the homecoming football game he performed the national anthem to complete his goal for his senior project,"" she said. ""This is one of the games that has the largest attendance and was a huge task to take on."" She told Storyful Jonathan had to shake off some nerves before performing and ""despite his nerves, and limited ASL knowledge, his performance was exceptional and inspirational to people throughout the world."" Edwards told Storyful she gave her friend Whitney Gustin Pollard permission to post the video publicly to her Facebook page on September 21, where it quickly garnered more than 3 million views.
